### Quality statement

teams to identify and plan their palliative care needs.

### Quality measure

assess the palliative care needs of people in the later stages of
dementia.

**Process:** Proportion of people in the later stages of dementia whose
palliative care needs are assessed by primary care teams and the

dementia have their palliative care needs assessed by primary care teams
and that the needs are communicated to other health and social care
staff.

Strategy](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130107105354/http:/www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_086277).
