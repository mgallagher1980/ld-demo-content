Quality statement 6: Emotional, psychological and social needs of carers
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Quality statement

Carers of people with dementia are offered an assessment of emotional,
psychological and social needs and, if accepted, receive tailored
interventions identified by a care plan to address those needs.

### Quality measure

**Structure:**

-   Evidence that those carrying out a carers' assessment identify any
    emotional and psychological needs and the social impact on the carer
    and offer the carer psychological therapy, including cognitive
    behavioural therapy (CBT), if clinically appropriate.

-   Evidence that this is an ongoing process and includes any period
    after the person with dementia has entered residential care.

-   Evidence that care plans for carers of people with dementia involve
    a range of tailored interventions, which consist of multiple
    components including:

    -   individual or group psychoeducation

    -   peer-support groups with other carers, tailored to the needs of
        individuals depending on the stage of dementia of the person
        being cared for and other characteristics.

**Process:**

​a) Proportion of carers of people with dementia who are offered an
assessment of their needs.

Denominator – the number of carers of people with dementia.

​b) Proportion of carers of people with dementia receiving interventions
tailored to their needs.
